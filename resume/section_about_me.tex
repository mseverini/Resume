\sectionTitle{About Me}{\faAddressCard}

\par{
	I am a software developer with over six years of experience. The majority of my development experience has been with ruby on rails but I also have experience with multiple other front and backend frameworks. I am passonate about building things. I love to dive in at every level  of the design cycle and make things work. I believe strongly in highly colaborative teams that are focused on delivering product value to customers. I am currently residing in BC, but I am a US citizen and fully qualified to work in either the US or Canada.
