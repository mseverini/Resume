\sectionTitle{Why \companyname}{\faQuestionCircle}

\par{
	I am looking to take my career in a direction that enables me to feel good about the contribution I am having on the world. The work being done at {\companyname} is exciting and sorely needed. I love the idea of contributing at such a mission focused company. Helping to curb the environmental impact of agriculture is a huge step forward in solving the climate crisis.
