    {Oct 19- Feb 21} {Senior Fullstack Engineer}{Mavenlink}{Salt Lake City Utah}
    {Aug 17 - Oct 18} {
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Nearly every line of code wrote at Mavenlink was paired on and test driven.
                        \item Re-built the integrations system from a fragile hand coded prototype to a robust user extensible platform.
                        \item Ported an auxiliary service from heroku to Kubernetes.
                        \item Architected and lead a team to implement a user configurable roll rased access management system. 
                        \item Wrote a service that was able to be easily reused for users to convert currency throughout the application.
                        \item Implemented a statistical testing system that would alert developers of failure rate changes.
                        \item Simple command line utility to run a single spec multiple times to see if it was susceptible to race conditions, or other intermittent behavior.
                        \item Optional git push hook that would merge master into your development brach if master had diverged.

    {Nov 18 - Sept 19} {Senior Software Engineer/Team Lead}{Recursion Pharmaceuticals}{Salt Lake City Utah}
    {}    {
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Compound management system migration:
                        When I took over as team lead, my team was tasked with a large scale project that was already 2 quarters over due. I worked with program and project management to identify MVP and facilitated team brainstorm sessions for a robust company wide migration plan. Together we were able to focus and finish the system in four weeks and successfully roll it out.
                        \item Implemented a weekly pairing session that has helped to take the team from individually responsible for pieces of the app, to shared ownership.
                        \item Implemented a bot that integrated github to our project management tool to allow for seamless velocity tracking and task management.
                        \item Added a universal UI for internal developer documentation that was quickly adopted.
                        \item Api caching layer bugfix that was missed by the previous three engineers that worked on the problem.
                      \end{itemize}
                    }
